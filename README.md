# Station Distance and Path Finder

This project implements a simple command-line application that allows users to find the shortest path and distance between stations using Dijkstra's algorithm. The application also provides information about directly connected stations.

## Features

- Display a list of stations with their corresponding indices.
- Calculate the shortest distance from a source station to any other station.
- Display the path taken from the source station to the destination station.
- List all stations directly connected to a given station.
